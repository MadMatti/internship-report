\section{Summary}
During my internship experience with Ubroker, I have developed my onw data mining project from scratch, developing the necessaries skills and knowledge.\\
The main objective of the project was to retrieve data about employees, company devices and their usage, and to create reports that would be useful for the company.\\
The project was developed in Python, language that I learned thanks to the constant support of my collegues.\\
The key points of the could be summarized as follows: data retrieval from Microsoft Azure, through the use of Microsoft Graph APIs, data cleaning and manipulation, data storage in an internal database,
and the creation of reports.\\
Although I found the project to be a challenging experience, I found it to be valuable in developing my skills in Python programming, data manipulation and database management.\\
